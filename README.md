# Create a Custom Activity for Azure Data Factory

I wrote a blob post on how to create a custom activity in Azure Data Factory to move (instead of copying) data from an Azure blob storage, to an Azure Data Lake Store. This is the code I used.

Creating a custom activity was the second part of a three part blob post that I wrote when learning Azure Data Factory.

You can find the blob post here: https://arvehansen.net/codecave/2017/08/18/azure-data-factory-part-2/
